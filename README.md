# News-Category-Classification


### Overview
This dataset contains around 200k news headlines from the year 2012 to 2018 obtained from HuffPost. The model trained on this dataset could be used to identify tags for untracked news articles or to identify the type of language used in different news articles.

#### Technical Aspect
I have created three separate files for this assignment:

1.Classification using-different-ml and lstm-models - This files contains the EDA , data preprocessing and building dufferent ML models and a simple NN model.

2.Using Glove Word Embedding - Used pretrained Glove word embeddings and LSTM model

3.News Category Classification using BERT  - Used BERT model for classification
